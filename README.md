## Abouts
**[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** is a Command Line Tool to simplify the installation of Linux Distros to the Android Operating System using Termux as a Shell environment. **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** also supports more than 6 Linux Distros [see](#linux-distros), as well as several Desktop Environments [see](#desktop-environment) and also Window Manager [view](#window-manager).

For problems with graphics rendering you need to know that Termux does not support it however, don't worry about that you can still achieve it with the help of VNC Viewer you can download it via Play Store for free.

## Notes
Maybe when you install a distro it will be fine until you successfully install it, but some distros may require some additional configuration to run well. But no need to worry about that, because you will still be able to use it.

## Dependency
Does **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** require additional dependencies? Yeah, but not much. All the required dependencies are all in a file called **dependencies**, you can read them with your favorite `cat` in the Terminal Emulator.

## Environment
If **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** uses the Shell as a programming language, does it require virtualization such as a Virtual Environment in the Python language? It can be yes or no, the environment here is intended to be a different situation because **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** is typed on a Laptop/PC so the **development** environment means that you will never install it, just create a system file folder like `{distro}-fs`

Meanwhile, the **production** environment is where you actually run it on your Termux and, you will actually install it. If you want to change the **[Penguin](https://github.com/hxAri/Penguin)** environment you just need to change the contents of the **environment** file to the environment you want (**production** is set to default)

#### Warning
If you set it to development and run it in Termux it will probably cause permission errors

```
Debian distro cli mode:
```sh
debian cli
```
Debian distro desktop environment mode:
```sh
debian desktop xfce
```
Debian distro window manager mode:
```sh
debian window awesome
```
And below is the usage for distros that have more than one version, such as Ubuntu:
```sh
# (distro) (version) (mode<cli|desktop<lxde|lxqt|mate|xfce>|window<awesome|openbox|i3>>)
```
Ubuntu distro cli mode:
```sh
ubuntu 22.04 cli
```
Ubuntu distro desktop environment mode:
```sh
ubuntu 22.04 desktop xfce
```
